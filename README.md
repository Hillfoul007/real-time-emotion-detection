# Real-Time Emotion Detection with Emojis 😄😢😠

This project is a real-time emotion detection system built using OpenCV, a pre-trained deep learning model (`.h5`), and deployed via Streamlit. It captures facial expressions from webcam input, classifies emotions using a CNN model, and overlays appropriate emojis on the detected faces in real time.

## 📌 Features

- 🎥 Live webcam feed integration.
- 🧠 Emotion prediction using a Keras `.h5` model.
- 😊 Automatic emoji overlay based on detected emotion.
- 💻 Streamlit interface for quick and easy web deployment.
- 🧪 Clean and modular code suitable for experimentation and learning.
